## Introduction

In data analysis and statistics, finding maximum values in datasets is a common task. Our library provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the maximum value from a strided array. The strided approach allows for efficient memory usage and processing speed, making it suitable for large datasets.

## Features

- **Efficient Calculation**: Optimized for performance when working with large arrays.
- **Custom Callback**: Allows users to define how to extract values from the array.
- **Supports Strided Arrays**: Works seamlessly with strided data for efficient access.
- **JavaScript Implementation**: Built with JavaScript, making it easy to integrate into Node.js applications.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install stats-strided-max-by
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can import the package into your project. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```javascript
const stridedMaxBy = require('stats-strided-max-by');

// Define your strided array
const data = new Float64Array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]);

// Define a callback function
const callback = (value) => value;

// Calculate the maximum value
const maxValue = stridedMaxBy(data, callback);
console.log(maxValue); // Outputs: 10
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

In this example, we calculate the maximum value of a simple strided array.

```javascript
const stridedMaxBy = require('stats-strided-max-by');

const data = new Float64Array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);
const maxValue = stridedMaxBy(data, (value) => value);
console.log(maxValue); // Outputs: 50
```

### Example 2: Custom Callback

You can also define a more complex callback function to extract values based on specific criteria.

```javascript
const stridedMaxBy = require('stats-strided-max-by');

const data = new Float64Array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);
const maxValue = stridedMaxBy(data, (value) => value * 2);
console.log(maxValue); // Outputs: 100
```

## API Documentation

### `stridedMaxBy(arr, callback)`

- **arr**: A strided array (e.g., `Float64Array`).
- **callback**: A function that takes an element from the array and returns a value to compare.

**Returns**: The maximum value found in the array based on the callback function.
